# Optomechanics-with-delayed-quantum-feedback

Simulation codes for the paper [Enhancing a slow and weak optomechanical nonlinearity with delayed quantum feedback](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15886).
- MPS simulation: TwoPhotonSweep.jl, g0Sweep.jl
- Semiclassical simulation (Fig. 6a and 6c): MB_Fidelity.m, Semi_Cal.m

Notice that the Julia codes were written for older Julia versions, such as v0.5.
